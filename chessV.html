<h1>Chess Variants</h1>
<p><mark>This section assumes you've read the rules of chess section,
    The chess variants shown on here will be: </mark>
    <ol>
        <li><mark>Chess960/Fisher random</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Alice Chess</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Anti-King Chess</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Bug House Chess</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Baroque</mark></li>


    </ol>

</p>

<h3><mark1>Chess960/Fisher random</mark1></h3>

<p>
<mark1>This variant is quite simple, all rules of chess apply,
    the only difference is that the pieces on the back row are shuffled into 
    one of 960 possible positions, black and white pieces mirror each other, 
    so kings are opposite each other, rooks are opposite each other etc,
    the restriction for how they are sorted is that the rooks must be either 
    side of the king (to allow both kingside and queenside castling) and
    second the bishops must be on opposite colours, this restricts it to
    960 arrangements, hence the name. The name Fisher random is from its 
    inventor, Bobby Fisher. Castling is done such that when the king and the 
    rook move, they end upin the same position as in regular chess.</mark1>
</p>

<h3><mark2>Alice Chess</mark2></h3>

<p>
    <mark2>Alice Chess is played with two boards, one starts out with all the pieces 
    (black and white) on it the other is empty. When a player makes a move
    the piece is "transported" to the other board, and to same square on that
    board. The basic rules of this variant are:</mark2>

    <ul>
        <li><mark2>For a move to be legal, the square on the other board
            must be vacant </mark2></li>
        <li><mark2>When capturing, a piece captures on the same board,
            then moves to the other board.</mark2></li> 
        <li><mark2>This means that a checking piece must be on the same
            board as the king when it delivers check (meaning you
            move a piece on the opposite board then move it over
            to the kings board)</mark2></li>
        <li><mark2>When a king moves (including moving out of check) the square it 
            moves to must also not be threatened by an opposing piece, 
            before it moves to the other board  </mark2>      </li>    
    </ul>
</p>

<h3><mark3>Anti-King Chess</mark3></h3>

<p>
<mark3>This variant is played with both players having an additional piece called
    an anti-king, the way this piece works is that, it is in check when it not being 
    attacked (each player's anti-king starts in front of the opponents queen,i.e it's
    attacked by the opponents kings pawn and queen bishop pawn). If the anti-king is 
    in check (meaning it's not under threat) and the player can't put it back under 
    threat, then the anti-king is checkmated, and they lose. In addition to checkmating
    the anti-king, a player can win by checkmating the regular king (in the usual way)
    Also the anti-king can't capture enemy pieces (of the opposite colour) but it can 
    capture friendly pieces (the same colour). Also I player can't attack the 
    opponents anti-king with their own regular king and can't put their own regular king 
    in check with their anti-king.</mark3>
</p>

<h3><mark4>Bug House Chess</mark4></h3>

<p>
<mark4>This variant is actually quite simple, it's played with two entire chess sets, and 
    4 players in partnerships. Lets say the first partnership is Player A and B 
    and the second is Player C and D,  Player A plays white against Player C, who 
    plays black, and Player B plays black against Player D, who plays white.
    If Player A captures a piece from Player C (a black piece) they can give it to their
    partner (player B who plays black), similarly Player B can capture a white piece from 
    Player D and give it to Player A (Player C and D can do the same with pieces they capture
    from Player A and B).
    A checkmate on either board wins it for the partnership</mark4>
</p>

<h4><mark5>TBaroque</mark5></h4>

<p>
    <mark5>  This is quite an unusual chess variant where the king moves and captures like a regular 
    chess king. Each of the pieces on the back row (excluding the king) can move like a queen, whereas 
    the pawns move like rooks. Also like already mentioned the King captures like a regular chess piece 
    (by landing on it's square) the other pieces have there own way of capturing. Also one of the rooks 
    is turned upside down (this rook doesn't capture). The first step is for each player to decide where 
    the king (left or right of the Queen, meaning they still go in the middle, but don't need to be 
    positioned normally), then decide which rook (left or right) is turned upside down. Also the pieces 
    have a new name. Also the goal is simply to capture the king. </mark5>
</p>

<h6><mark5>This is a list of pieces (with examples of capture)</mark5></h6>

<ul><mark5>Pieces</mark5></ul>
   <li><mark5>Withdrawer (represented by the queen): it captures by moving away from the piece it's capturing.</mark5>
    <ul>
        <li><mark5>if the withdrawer is on f5, an enemy piece (A) is on f4 and enemy piece (B) is on g5, then by 
        moving up the withdrawer captures A or by moving to the left it captures (B)</mark5></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><mark5>Co-ordinator (represented by the rook that is right side up): If after the co-ordinator moves, it's not in the same row/column as it's king then those two 
    form two corners of a rectangle, any enemy pieces at the other two corners will be captured </mark5>
     <ul>
        <li><mark5>If the co-ordinator moved to f5, and it's king was on c2, then any enemy pieces on f2 or c5 will be captured </mark5></li>
        </ul>
      </li>  
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark5>Leapers (represented as the knights): they capture by jumping over a piece and land on the square beyond (only if it's vacant)</mark5>
 <ul>
    <li><mark5>If a leaper is on f5 and an enemy piece is on f2 the leaper can move to f1 assuming there is nothing in the way (except the piece on f2 and given that f1 is vacant</mark5></li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li><mark5>Pincers (represented by the pawns): they capture by sandwiching an enemy piece between itself and another friendly piece (all three need to have no gaps between them) also 
    it only works orthogonaly</mark5>
   <ul>
    <li><mark5>If a pincer moves to f5 and there is an enemy piece on f4 and a friendly piece on f3, the enemy piece is captured  </mark5></li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><mark5>Immobilizer (reprented by the upside down rook): this piece doesn't capture it simply immobilizes any enemy piece withing a king move of itself, if both immobilizers are next 
    to each other, neither can move until the other is captured.</mark5>
</li>
 <ul>
    <li><mark5>If the immobilizer is on f5 and an emeny piece is on f6 the piece on f6 can't move until the immobilzer moves away or is captured</mark5></li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li><mark5>Chameleon (represented by the bishops): these pieces simply imitate the other pieces by capturing tham how they would capture</mark5></li>
 <ul>
    <li><mark5>If a chameleon is on f5 and the enemy king is on f6, then if it's the kings turn to move, the king can land on the chameleons 
        square and capture it, if it was the chameleons turn it could land on the kings square and capture it (therefore winning the game)</mark5> </li>
    <li><mark5>If a chameleon is on f5 and the enemy withdrawer is on f6 then if it is the withdrawers turn to move it can move up and doing so capture the chameleon, or if it the chameleons move
        if can move down and capture the withdrawer </mark5></li> 
        <li><mark5>If a chameleon moves to f5 and it's king is on c2 then if the enemy Co-ordinator is on either f2 or c5 the chameleon will capture the co-ordinator</mark5></li>
    <li><mark5>If a chameleon is on f5 and a leaper is on f2 then if it is the leaper's turn to move and given that there are no pieces between them and f6 is vacant, the leaper can jump to f6 and 
        capture the chameleon or the chameleon can capture the leaper by jumping over the leaper to f1 (again given that f1 is vacant and there are no pieces bewteen them)</mark5>
    </li> 
    <li><mark5>If a chameleon moves to f5 and there is an enemy pincer on f4 and a friendly piec on f3 the chameleon will capture the pincer</mark5></li>  
    <li><mark5>If a chameleon is on or moves to f5, and the enemy immobilizer is on g5 then neither can move until one if captured</mark5></li>
 </ul>
