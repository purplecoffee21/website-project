    <p>Here you will learn about the general rules of chess.
       First you need to know about the equipment needed and how to set everything up.
       Each Player has 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights and 8 Pawns.
       The board consists of 64 squares (8x8) alternating between black and white 
       (some sets might have other colours). Also white (or what the lightest colour is)
       moves first.
       </p>

     <p>
       The board need to be positioned so that each player has a white sqauare in the 
       bottom right hand corner.
       To arrange the pieces: The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them,
       followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching 
       color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining 
       square.
    </p>

    <h1>How the pieces move</h1>
<ol>
    <li> The king can only move one square in any direction 
        - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally.</li>

        <img src="phpB5EGM1.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <li>The queen can move in any one straight direction 
        - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally 
        - as far as possible as long as she 
        does not move through any of her own pieces.</li>

        <img src="php1q99kj.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <li>The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, 
        backward, and to the sides. Just like the queen it doesn't 
    move through other pieces</li>    
    
     <img src="phpMa2giQ.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <li>The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. 
        Each bishop starts on one color and must always stay on that color.</li> 

        <img src="phpk2SBUp.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <li>Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces 
        - going two squares in one direction, and then one more move 
        at a 90-degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”.
    Knights can also jump over other pieces.</li> 

    <img src="phpVuLl4W.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <li>Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different
         ways: they move forward but capture diagonally. 
         Pawns can only move forward one square at a time,
          except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.</li>

        </ol>

    


<h4>Capturing</h4>

<p>Capturing is done the same way a piece moves (accept for the pawn as mentioned above)
    Pieces occupy the captured pieces square, also with the bishop, rook or queen, their move 
    ends when they capture.
</p>
    
<h4>Check and Checkmate</h4>

<p>The king is the most important piece on the board, if the king is in danger of being captured,
    he is said to be "in check" and the player has to immediately remove the check, either by
    moving the king, capturing the checking piece or putting a piece between the king and
    the checking piece, if none of these are possible then it's checkmate and the game is over. 
    Checkmating the opponents king is the objective of chess.
    During the game a player is not allowed to make a move that puts their king in check, either 
    by moving the king into check or moving a piece out of the way, therby exposing the king to 
    check
</p>

<h4>Draws</h4>

<p1>There are 5 different ways a game can end in a draw

<ol1>
    <li>Stalemate: this occurs when the player who's turn it is to move,
        the king is not in check but they have no legal move.
    </li>
    <li>Insufficent material: of it's King vs King, King vs King and Bishop/Knight, King vs King and
     any number of Bishops on the same colour or King and Bishop vs King and Bishop where both Bishops 
     on the same color then there's not enough for either player to checkmate.
     also a locked position (insuffient material draws are also locked) see below </li>
     <li>Mutual agreement: both player agree to a draw</li>
    <li>50 move rule: if 50 moves are played without a piece being captured or a pawn being moved, 
        either player can claim a draw (if they can prove that this has occurred)</li>
    <li>3 fold repetition: if the same position, with the rights to en passant (see below) and castling (see
        below) are the same and the same player to move happens for the 3rd time (not necessarily in a row),
        the game can be declared a draw. (again if it can be proved)
    </li>
</ol1>
</p1>

<h4>Here are two examples of locked positions:  </h4>

        <img src="Captureb.PNG" alt="position2" style="width:100px;height:100px">
     </div>
</div>



<h4>Additional rules</h4>

<p>

    En passant: if a pawn moves two squares on its first move and there is an enemy pawn right next to it,
    then on the next move, the enemy pawn can move to the square behind the pawn and capture it without 
    landing on it's square.

    Promotion: if a pawn reaches the 8th rank (the rows) it can be promoted to any piece (of the same colour)
    except for a king or another pawn. 

    Castling: a special move called castling is where the king and rook move together (as one move), the 
    king moves two squares towards the rook and the rook jumps over the king to square on the other side (see below)
    this can only be done if: it's the kings first move, the rooks first move, there are no pieces between them,
    the king doesn't move from check, through check or into check. 

    Also a piece pinned against the king (it's blocking the check of another piece) it can still check the enemy king.

     </div>
</div>

<h4>Notation</h4>

<p>Also the way you prove 50 moves and 3 fold repetition is through recording moves through notation, one of the simplest is
    algebraic notation, each piece has a letter K(King), Q(Queen), R(Rook), B(Bishop), N(Knight) and P(Pawn), though usually 
    the P is excluded. the files (vertical line, i.e. columns) are from right to left (with white at the bottom) are a, b, c, 
    d, e, f, g, h. The ranks (rows) from bottom to top, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So c5 is the square on the 3rd file (from the
     left) and 5 rank from the bottom. to write a move (or a pair of moves: a white move followed by black move) is written as 
     1(White's move) (Blacks move). A move is written as the piece (its letter) and the square it moves to, with the P of pawn 
     excluded, for a capture to seperate the letter and co-ordinate with "x", sometimes if there's more than one of a piece that 
     can move to a square you put in info about it starting square. 

     Examples: "e4" means a pawm moving to e4, "Qf7" a queen moving to f7, "Rxe6" a rook capturing a piece on e6, "Rd-f6" a rook 
     moving to f6 (but the other rook can also move there so it's saying the rook on d file).
